**Mancala** is a traditional strategy board game, also known as *Awalé*, with origins in Africa. The game revolves around the strategic sowing of seeds to capture as many as possible.

---

## Game Overview

Mancala is typically played on a wooden or plastic board featuring:

* **Pits** – Usually 6 on each side of the board.
* **Stores** – Large pits located at each end of the board, used for collecting captured seeds.
* **Seeds** – Each small pit begins with 4 seeds.

## Rules of Play

1. Players take turns choosing one pit from their side of the board.
2. All seeds from the chosen pit are picked up and distributed one by one in a counterclockwise direction into subsequent pits, including the player’s store but skipping the opponent’s store.
3. If the last seed lands in the player’s store, they take an extra turn.
4. The game ends when all pits on one player’s side are empty.
5. The player with the highest number of seeds in their store at the end of the game wins.
