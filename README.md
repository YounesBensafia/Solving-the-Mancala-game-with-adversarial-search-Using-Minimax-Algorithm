# Mancala

**Mancala** is a traditional sowing game, also known as *Awal√©*, originating in Africa. The game involves strategic placement of seeds on a board to collect as many as possible.

## Game Description

Mancala is played on a board with:  
- **Small Pits**: Typically 6 on each side.  
- **Stores**: One large pit at each end (used for collecting seeds).  
- **Seeds**: Each small pit starts with 4 seeds.

### How to Play
1. Players take turns selecting a pit from their side of the board.
2. All seeds from the chosen pit are picked up and sown one-by-one counterclockwise into subsequent pits.  
3. If the last seed lands in your *store*, you get an extra turn.  
4. The game ends when all pits on one player's side are empty.  
5. The player with the most seeds in their store wins.
